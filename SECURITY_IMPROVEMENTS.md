- **Key-Based Authentication**: Enforced SSH key authentication, disabled password auth
- **Root Login Disabled**: Prevented direct root access for enhanced security

### Network Security
- **Granular Egress Rules**: Restricted outbound traffic to only necessary ports and destinations
- **Private Subnet Access**: Limited bastion access to private subnets only
- **Security Group Hardening**: Enhanced security group rules with proper descriptions

### Instance Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: Enabled EBS encryption for bastion host
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented comprehensive OS-level security hardening
- **IAM Integration**: Added proper IAM roles with minimal required permissions

### Monitoring and Logging
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Configured SSH activity logging
- **Security Alerts**: Set up monitoring for SSH login attempts
- **SNS Notifications**: Implemented alerting for suspicious activities

## 3. Static Website Project Security Improvements

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented IP-based rate limiting (2000 requests per 5 minutes)
- **Attack Protection**: Added rules to block common attack patterns
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Configured managed rules to prevent SQL injection
- **XSS Protection**: Implemented protection against cross-site scripting attacks

### Content Security
- **Security Headers**: Added comprehensive security headers via CloudFront
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'

### Storage Security
- **S3 Encryption**: Enabled server-side encryption for all S3 buckets
- **Versioning**: Enabled versioning for audit trail and recovery
- **Public Access Block**: Prevented public access to S3 buckets
- **Bucket Policies**: Implemented least-privilege access policies

### Logging and Monitoring
- **WAF Logging**: Configured comprehensive WAF activity logging via Kinesis Firehose
- **CloudFront Logging**: Enabled access logging for all requests
- **Encrypted Log Storage**: All logs stored with encryption at rest

### TLS/SSL Security
- **TLS 1.2+**: Enforced minimum TLS version 1.2_2021
- **SNI Support**: Enabled Server Name Indication for modern browsers
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper ACM certificate validation and renewal

## 4. Global Security Improvements

### Linting and Compliance
- **Enhanced TFLint Rules**: Added security-focused linting rules
- **Resource Tagging**: Enforced consistent tagging for cost and security management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive security documentation and comments

### Best Practices Implementation
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: All IAM roles and policies follow least privilege
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Secure by Default**: All resources configured with secure defaults
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for all security-relevant activities

## 5. Security Recommendations for Production

### Network Security
1. **Restrict CIDR Blocks**: Replace 0.0.0.0/0 with specific corporate IP ranges
2. **VPN Access**: Implement VPN for secure remote access
3. **Network Segmentation**: Further segment networks based on application tiers

### Access Management
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement MFA for all user access
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement RBAC for different user types
3. **Session Management**: Implement session timeouts and recording

### Monitoring and Alerting
1. **SIEM Integration**: Integrate logs with Security Information and Event Management
2. **Real-time Alerts**: Configure real-time alerting for security events
3. **Incident Response**: Develop incident response procedures

### Compliance
1. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
2. **Compliance Frameworks**: Align with SOC 2, ISO 27001, or other relevant frameworks
3. **Security Training**: Regular security awareness training for team members

## 6. Cost Considerations

### Security Investments
- **WAF**: ~$1 per million requests + $0.60 per rule per month
- **CloudTrail**: ~$2.00 per 100,000 events
- **VPC Flow Logs**: ~$0.50 per GB
- **CloudWatch Logs**: ~$0.50 per GB ingested + $0.03 per GB stored

### Cost Optimization
- **Log Retention**: Configure appropriate log retention periods
- **WAF Rules**: Only enable necessary WAF rules
- **Monitoring**: Use appropriate CloudWatch metrics and alarms

## 7. Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Tasks
1. **Security Updates**: Regular OS and application security updates
2. **Certificate Renewal**: Monitor and renew SSL certificates
3. **Access Reviews**: Regular review of IAM permissions and access
4. **Security Patches**: Apply security patches promptly

### Continuous Improvement
1. **Security Monitoring**: Regular review of security logs and alerts
2. **Threat Intelligence**: Stay updated with latest security threats
3. **Best Practices**: Continuously improve security posture

## Conclusion

These security improvements significantly enhance the security posture of all three Terraform projects. The implementations follow AWS Well-Architected Framework security pillar best practices and provide a solid foundation for production deployments. Regular monitoring, maintenance, and updates are essential to maintain security effectiveness over time.
