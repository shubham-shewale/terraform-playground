## Deployment Verification

### Network Security
- [ ] VPC and subnets are created correctly
- [ ] Security groups are applied and functioning
- [ ] Bastion host is accessible from allowed IPs only
- [ ] Private instance is not directly accessible from internet
- [ ] NAT Gateway provides secure egress for private subnet

### Instance Configuration
- [ ] Bastion host has fail2ban installed and running
- [ ] SSH configuration is hardened (no password auth, no root login)
- [ ] Both instances have encrypted EBS volumes
- [ ] User data scripts executed successfully
- [ ] IAM instance profiles are attached correctly

### Access Verification
- [ ] SSH key pair is created and accessible
- [ ] Bastion host SSH access works from allowed IPs
- [ ] Private instance access through bastion works
- [ ] Direct internet access to private instance is blocked
- [ ] IAM permissions are working as expected

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] CloudTrail is logging AWS API calls
- [ ] VPC Flow Logs are capturing network traffic
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms are active and configured
- [ ] SNS topics are receiving notifications
- [ ] SSH login attempt monitoring is working

## Post-Deployment Security Testing

### Access Control Testing
- [ ] Attempt SSH access from non-allowed IP (should fail)
- [ ] Verify password authentication is disabled
- [ ] Test root login attempts are blocked
- [ ] Confirm fail2ban blocks repeated failed attempts
- [ ] Validate SSH key-based authentication works

### Network Security Testing
- [ ] Verify security group rules are enforced
- [ ] Test that private instance cannot reach internet directly
- [ ] Confirm bastion host can reach private instance
- [ ] Validate VPC Flow Logs are capturing traffic
- [ ] Test NAT Gateway functionality

### Monitoring Validation
- [ ] Trigger SSH login attempts and verify alarms
- [ ] Check CloudTrail logs for bastion-related API calls
- [ ] Verify VPC Flow Logs are being generated
- [ ] Test SNS notifications are being sent
- [ ] Validate CloudWatch metrics are being collected

## Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
- [ ] Monitor SSH login attempts and fail2ban logs
- [ ] Review CloudWatch alarms and notifications
- [ ] Check VPC Flow Logs for suspicious traffic patterns

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review CloudWatch logs for security events
- [ ] Check for security updates on EC2 instances
- [ ] Monitor SSH access patterns for anomalies
- [ ] Verify backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Review SNS alert history

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Conduct security group and NACL review
- [ ] Audit IAM permissions and access patterns
- [ ] Update security documentation and procedures
- [ ] Review monitoring and alerting configurations
- [ ] Validate encryption and security controls

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Perform comprehensive security assessment
- [ ] Rotate SSH keys and update access lists
- [ ] Review and update incident response procedures
- [ ] Conduct security awareness training
- [ ] Evaluate and implement security improvements

## Security Metrics & KPIs

### Access Control Metrics
- Number of failed SSH login attempts
- Number of blocked IPs by fail2ban
- SSH session duration and frequency
- IAM permission usage patterns

### Network Security Metrics
- VPC Flow Log analysis results
- Security group rule violations
- Network traffic patterns and anomalies
- NAT Gateway usage and performance

### Monitoring Effectiveness
- CloudWatch alarm trigger frequency
- SNS notification delivery success rate
- CloudTrail log completeness
- Incident detection and response time

## Incident Response Procedures

### SSH Brute Force Attack
1. **Detection**: CloudWatch alarm triggers on high login attempts
2. **Containment**: Fail2ban automatically blocks attacking IP
3. **Investigation**: Review VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail for attack patterns
4. **Recovery**: Update security groups if needed, rotate keys if compromised
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update monitoring thresholds or access controls

### Unauthorized Access
1. **Detection**: Unusual SSH access patterns or CloudWatch alerts
2. **Containment**: Immediately revoke access, block IP addresses
3. **Investigation**: Review CloudTrail logs and SSH session logs
4. **Recovery**: Rotate SSH keys, update access lists, strengthen controls
5. **Prevention**: Implement additional authentication layers

### Instance Compromise
1. **Detection**: Unusual network traffic or system behavior
2. **Containment**: Isolate instance, disable access, stop suspicious processes
3. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis of logs and system state
4. **Recovery**: Rebuild instance from clean image, restore from backups
5. **Prevention**: Implement host-based intrusion detection

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Configure allowed_ssh_cidrs**: Set specific IP ranges for SSH access
2. **Generate SSH Keys**: Create strong SSH key pairs for authentication
3. **Enable Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms and SNS notifications
4. **Review Access**: Regularly audit who has bastion access

### Advanced Security Measures
1. **Session Recording**: Implement SSH session recording for compliance
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add MFA for bastion access where possible
3. **Network Segmentation**: Implement additional network security layers
4. **Automated Response**: Set up automated responses to security events

### Cost Optimization
- **Instance Sizing**: Use appropriate instance types for your access patterns
- **Log Retention**: Configure optimal log retention periods
- **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch efficiently to control costs
- **Storage**: Optimize S3 storage classes for log data
